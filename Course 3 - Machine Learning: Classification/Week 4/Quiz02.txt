1. False.

2. - So many features are skipped that accuracy can degrade.
   - If an input at prediction time has a feature missing 
     that was always present during training, this approach 
     is not applicable.

3. False.

4. N.

5. D.

6. - Imputed values can be used in any classification algorithm.
   - Imputed values can be used when there is missing data at prediction time.

7. We choose to assign missing values to the branch of the tree (either 
   the one with feature value equal to 0 or with feature value equal to 1) 
   that minimizes classification error.
